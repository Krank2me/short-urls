This is a simple short-url service that works with
[netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) and uses
[airtable](https://airtable.com).

## üöÄ Live demo

[ssoon.io](https://ssoon.io/)

Now go ahead and test that your redirects are working as expected. Just go to
the short URL version of your netlify app and it should redirect you like so:
http://ssoon.io/codeBase -> https://github.com/khriztianmoreno/ssoon-short-urls/

If that works you're on the right track!
